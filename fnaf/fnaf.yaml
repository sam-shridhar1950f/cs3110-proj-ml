  Our project is a riff on the popular horror strategy game Five Night At
  Freddy's. The animatronics are the classic four characters from the original 
  game: Chica, Foxy, Bonnie, and Freddy Fazbear. Beyond the theme, gameplay 
  such as the central office, monsters following set patterns, and the original
  goal of the game to survive through the night are the same. It's the classic 
  game, but revamped with plenty of exciting and challenging features like power
  and difficulty modes, random power ups and debuffs, and so much more!
